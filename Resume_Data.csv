Weekend/Academic Projects:
1) URL Shortner: Implementation of URL shortening service using MD5 hash and BASE62 encoding.
https://github.com/242jainabhi/URL_Shortner.git
2) BlackJack: Low level design of BlackJack game.

https://github.com/242jainabhi/Object-Oriented-Design/tree/master/Design%20Blackjack
3) Linux Commands Simulator:
https://github.com/242jainabhi/LinuxCommandsSimulator
4) In-memory SQL like Database:
https://github.com/242jainabhi/In-Memory_SQL_Database
5) Prevention of SQL Injection Attacks: @ VIT University
a) Description: This project provides a solution for SQL Injections. SQL Injection refers to an attack wherein an
attacker can execute malicious SQL statements which controls a web applications database server. By
leveraging an SQL Injection vulnerability, given the right circumstances, an attacker can use it to bypass a
web applications authentication and authorization mechanisms and retrieve the contents of an entire
database. SQL Injection can also be used to add, modify and delete records in a database, affecting data
integrity.
b) Responsibility: My responsibility was to develop an efficient and optimized algorithm which can detect a
repeated attacking pattern and learn a new attacking pattern. Patterns were detected using regular
expressions. Detected patterns were then added in a database table using bloom filters. I also designed the
database and UI for the project which were used to simulate the attack.
6) Screen Flags: @ VIT University
a) Description: Screen Flags is a Bookmarking Application. An application using which a user can store
bookmarks in the form of thumbnails or screenshots of webpages. These bookmarks are secured and
accessible from anywhere, independent of machine and browser. If a user wants to bookmark a webpage,
she can add the URL of the webpage in this tool, eventually a screenshot of that webpage will be generated
and displayed.
b) Responsibility: To build end to end application to accomplish the task of generating and storing flags. A
service called Web Shrinker was used to generate the flags when provided the URL. These flags were them
stored into the database for the respective user.
7) Admission Management Tool: @ DreamTeam Technologies
a) Description: This tool was developed to ease the admission process of a student. Colleges and Schools
would use this tool to manage database of students, teachers and courses which students have opted. When
a student is selected, this tool would display students personal info, parents details, subjects and courses
opted, and teachers associated with subjects.
b) Responsibility: I was given a task to develop an API which would communicate with database and fetch
required data. This API was written in PHP, which would read request from client and pass that request to the
server. Then server would further communicate to the database to fetch the required data. This data would
then be displayed at client side.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Morph Digital Solutions | Full Stack Developer

Transitioned towards full stack development with improving my backend capability using
Nodejs and Python. Successfully delivered numerous POCs for Wipros internal projects.
Reduced the delivery time for such POCs by leveraging the ease of using Nodejs
framework and deployed on AWSs EC2 instance for better and faster accessibility. Highly
skilled in delivering time framed projects for Dubai government, these projects were
usually live for a period of 2-3 days for events like GITEX, Dubai Expo, DIMS. These small
projects increased revenue by 40% annually. Working on such time framed projects,
helped me to dive deeper into the Project Management aspects adopting agile
methodologies.

Jan 13  Jan 16 | India

Started my development career with PHP, REST APIs and helped build an innovative
product Cuztomise which turned out to be a game changer for the company with over

projects helped me to have a better grip over server-side scripting, building REST APIs
and designing database architecture.

Processing(SIP) path by bypassing the color flow data and sharing it to a 3rd party Application that
processes the data and gives out results. It involves modifying and developing of new SIP graphs and
Voyager Codebase(C++). It will be a new tool to diagnose Liver cirrhosis.



Fetal Biometry (Conda, Paraview)
Fetal biometry involved setting up of Conda Environment on VPC to check the feasibility of running
the algorithm developed by Medisys on sample volume data and visualizing the plane in Paraview by
using plane parameters acquired from the algorithm. This plane will generate the biometric
parameters of a fetus using 3D Ultrasound.



Follicle Detection on Android Platform (DL, Nvidia DIGITS, Android NDK)
Follicle Detection on Android Platform involved comparing different models based on different
neural networks generated using the same dataset and integrating yolo model to Android app to
highlight the follicles present in a live scan. It is a plausible solution to integrate with hand-held
ultrasound devices like Lumify.
